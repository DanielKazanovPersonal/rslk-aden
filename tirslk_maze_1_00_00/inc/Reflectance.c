// Reflectance.c
// Provide functions to take measurements using a QTR-8RC reflectance
// sensor array (Pololu part number 961).  This works by outputting to
// the sensor, waiting, then reading the digital value of each of the
// eight phototransistors.  The more reflective the target surface is,
// the faster the voltage decays.
