// InputOutput.c
// Runs on MSP432
// Test the GPIO initialization functions by setting the LED
// color according to the status of the switches.
// Only SW1 makes color LED blue, and red LED on
// Only SW2 makes color LED red, and red LED on
// Both SW1 and SW2 makes color LED purple, and red LED on
// Neither SW1 or SW2 turns LEDs off
